        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>During our project, we learned a lot about how to use Html, Css and JavaScript to create websites. We improved our knowledge and logic to be better in the process of creation !</p>

            <p>When we chose to talk about coding for our IT subject so we decided to create from zero our blog by coding it. We started by creating an organized directory and a README file with all the tasks we needed to do and that will present our project. After that we created empty files of html, css and javascript of the different pages and we finally coded all of them during hundreds of hours.</p>

            <a href="https://mimo.org/"><img src="../../img/project2.png"></a>
            <p>To do this blog, some people in the group had basic knowledge on coding languages we used for the blog but it was not enough to complete it. That's when we discovered MIMO.org which is an app and a website that allows us to learn and to practice the basics for who needed it in the group. Ethan bought the full version with all courses to earn further knowledge on functions, animations, styles and so on.</p>
