        <h1>Cascading Style Sheets</h1>
        <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a vital technology for web development. It allows developers to separate content from design, ensuring that websites are both visually appealing and functional. CSS works alongside HTML and JavaScript to create the overall look and feel of a web page.<br><br>With CSS, you can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. For instance, you can define styles for text, such as font size, color, and spacing, as well as for other elements like margins, borders, and backgrounds. This consistency in design not only enhances user experience but also simplifies maintenance.<br><br>One of the key features of CSS is the concept of 'cascading'. This means that styles can be applied in a hierarchical manner, allowing for more flexibility and control. If there are conflicting styles, CSS rules follow a specific order of precedence: inline styles are given the highest priority, followed by internal styles within a style tag, and finally external styles linked through a separate CSS file.<br><br>Furthermore, CSS enables responsive design, which is crucial for modern web development. Responsive design ensures that websites look good on various devices, from desktops to smartphones. This is achieved through media queries, which apply different styles depending on the device's characteristics, like its screen size.<br><br>In conclusion, CSS is an essential tool for web developers, providing the means to create attractive, user-friendly, and adaptable websites. Its ability to manage the presentation layer of web pages makes it indispensable in the world of web development.</p>
