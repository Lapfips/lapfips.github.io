            Finally, it's time to leave for Porto. The rendez-vous was at 1:15pm
            at the airport, it was time to meet up with the other class. Our
            group composed of Ethan, Alix, Adrien, Florian and Pixel was ready
            to fly to the second biggest Portuguese city. After waiting 3 hours
            we finally take off for a 2 hours fly. Barely off the plane,
            problems started. At the luggage receipt, everyone retrieved their
            own suitcase without any issue.

            Only one was missing, the Ethan's one. Because the latter saw it
            before, he was not worried about it. However, 5 then 10 minutes
            passed and still no sign of his suitcase, he then observed that only
            one blue luggage was left that looked like his own. Therefore, he
            understood that someone made a mistake and stole his suitcase.
            Fortunately on the thief's luggage was a card with his information.
            So Ethan called him, he was french and was 30 minutes away from the
            airport. The man immediately understood his mistake and came back.
            After waiting for 1 hour, they both exchanged their suitcase and
            Ethan return to his classmates who was waiting for him in the bus.
            The bus drove them to their hostel where Miss Villa (the english
            teacher) took a group picture of both classes. The rooms were
            previously chosen,so we knew where we have to go: Ethan, Alix,
            Adrien and Pixel went to their room with Quentin.C, Quentin.G, Lucca
            and Raphael.On his side, Florian was with Fabien, Benoit and Theo.

            When the night came, it was time to eat and we were looking for a
            typical restaurant near the inn. We walked through the streets for
            an hour but in vain, so we decided to eat in a Italian dinner. We
            ate pizzas and spaghetti and then came back to the youth hostel. At
            the end of the day we were tired of the day and wanted a break
            before sleeping, so we chose to play "Werewolves" until 2am. After
            that we went to bed to prepare ourselves to the first day of school
            in Portugal.

            It's time to wake up and to plan the schedule for the shower in our
            room of seven people. Adrien was mad at Quentin.G because he snored
            all the night. Because we started class at 11am and that Adrien,
            Alix and Quentin.C were ready they went to the park in front of the
            hostel to visit the district. This group took the bus at 10:30am
            because the second group composed of Ethan, Quentin.G, Raphael and
            Lucca were not ready. These latter tried to take the next one but
            the next 2 buses never came until the third one at 10:50am arrived.

            They took it but were stuck in the traffic jams so for the first day
            they were 40 minutes late. The first class of the trip was about the
            Portugal culture and vocabulary, it was interesting to discover the
            "Fado" and language in general. At 1pm, we learned from Etienne and
            Krista that we did not have to stay in the school for the afternoon
            because it was sunny and they wanted us to enjoy this weather by
            visiting the city. For the lunch, all our group except Ethan went to
            the Capra restaurant with Etienne where we discovered that Portuan
            were swindler. Indeed, they needed to pay for absolutely everything
            without knowing they had to pay for it.

            After that, we walked through the city and ate "pasteis de nata" for
            the first time of this trip. Ethan who did not have a lot of money
            try to keep it by walking back to the inn to take pictures for the
            blog instead of going to the restaurant and he then worked on the
            blog. Before the dinner we met again and played "President" and
            "Werewolves" again. After that, Quentin.C offers us to cook. On his
            side, Ethan ate what Lucca left from his lunch with some watermelon
            that Theo kindly gave him. Then it was time to go to sleep.

            This day was the first with the real schedule for classes. So we
            needed to take the breakfast between 7:30am and 8:30am after taking
            a shower one after another. Then, the brave Ethan walked to school
            under the rain and the rest of the group took the metro. The class
            this morning was SEO which talked about how is working the search
            engines but it was hard to follow because the other class was very
            loud. For the lunch, we went to Lidl to buy some dishes to save
            money not to spend it all in 3 days.

            At the beginning of the afternoon we had to finish our survey that
            we started in class a few months ago to use it later in the day.
            After an hour, we went to the "Mercado do Bolh√£o" where we
            interviewed some people with our questions. For more information, go
            to the activities page of our website under the day 3. For the
            dinner, Lou cooked for Theo and Ethan, it was some pasta and chicken
            with cream, mushrooms and cheese. After that, as usual, we played
            "Werewolves" and went to bed.

            Our routine was set and again we took a shower one after an other,
            ate breakfast and went to school. Ethan was not alone anymore to
            walk to school because Joana and Adrien join him. We knew that it
            was the last day of Etienne in Porto so we wanted to make him happy
            by organizing a dinner for him in his honor. The class this morning
            was about chatgpt: how it works and how to use it correctly.The
            afternoon was a free time so with our group we decided to come back
            to the hostel to rest a bit.

            In the evening many things happened. Indeed, it was time for the
            dinner we organized for Etienne, 32 people were there and ate a lot,
            it was really funny to have so many people eating together. At the
            end of the meal, everyone walked to their hostels, that is when we
            left Krista and Etienne that went to sleep. After that, we bought
            alcohol and stay in the park in front of our inn. After a while,
            everyone went to sleep except for Alix, Quentin.C, Quentin.G and
            Ethan. They bought and ate kebabs at 2am but Alix was a bit drunk
            and it was hard for him to walk. Fortunately, Ethan that did not
            drink at all helped him acting like the "Sam" of his group. Finally,
            they went to sleep.

            As usual, we took the breakfast after the shower, then we took the
            metro to go to school, it was the first time Ethan took it
            here.Today's class was about Python. Unfortunately, the professor
            was a bit sick and it was hard for him to talk, so he offered us to
            read texts in his stead to make us practice the IT vocabularies in
            front the class which was really interesting for us and our
            learning. Not everyone liked that, indeed, a student who did not
            want to read insulted his classmate who chose him to read after.

            Because it was all in french the professor could not do anything
            because he did not understand his racist and insulting words. Then
            we ate and worked for an hour on the blog before the cruise. We had
            some issues with this latter because we waited from 3pm to 5pm to
            board on the boat to see the Douro's bridges and to learn some
            information about them, we were quite disappointed by the waiting
            time and the goal of the cruise. After that, we took the bus to come
            back to the hostel. Ethan and Quentin.C cooked for the group during
            an hour to prepare some Sicilian pastas while Quentin.G and Adrien
            were watching the rugby match with Pixel. When it was ready, we ate
            and went to sleep while one of our classmate was jumping from a
            bridge that we saw earlier in the day.

            For this sixth day in Porto, we had to meet up with the bus at
            9:30am at the ISLA university so as every morning we took a shower
            and ate breakfast then went to the school thanks to the metro. The
            bus took us to the Metyis company where we participated in
            conferences. The first one talked about what is Metyis, who they
            are, what they do and how they do it. After that, we visited the
            Hugo Boss building next to Metyis building because they are in
            collaboration.

            We were lucky to see people working in open-plan offices which gave
            us an idea of the work conditions we will experience later. Then, we
            add a break when they offered us drinks and snacks. The second
            conference followed this break. It was presented by two Metyis
            workers, they explained us their jobs, one works in a front-end
            service while the second one works on the back-end parts of websites
            and apps of their clients. They presented some examples of their
            projects and it was really interesting for us. At the end of the
            visit, it was time to come back to the school with the bus but Ethan
            was able to negotiate with Krista to stay there to eat in a local
            restaurant and that they will come back by themselves.

            Our whole group plus Quentin.C and Quentin.G went to a good
            restaurant where we ate for 7,50‚Ç¨ per person to have: a soup as
            starter, a complete plate as main course, a drink and a coffee. At
            the end of the meal, we took a taxi for 6 people for only 12‚Ç¨ for a
            23 minutes drive which is not expensive at all for this service. We
            worked on the blog and take some time for us this afternoon. In the
            evening, we ate and went to bed.

            This day was the first our week-end and decided not to do anything.
            We woke up late and watched the final of the rugby match between
            Toulouse and Leinster. Of course, it was Toulouse that won and we
            celebrated it together with beers and snacks. Pixel was the number 1
            supporter, he had the color of the Stade Toulousain on him. We
            ordered burgers at night and played video games together and then
            went to sleep.

            On sunday, again we decided not to to do many things. However,
            Oph√©lie arrived and we wanted to make her discover a part of the
            city and its culture so we walked for an hour through the city, we
            stopped by a kind of pub to drink a beer and then went to Mcdonald's
            and saw that there is a soup in the menu in Portugal. Alix wanted to
            try it but unfortunately, it was awful. Furthermore, Quentin.G who
            is a bit clumsy spilled his drink on Oph√©lie and Ethan, it was okay
            for this latter who only received a few drops of it, but Oph√©lie on
            her side took everything in her bag which damaged most of it. Adrien
            and Alix took Oph√©lie back to her hostel while Ethan and Quentin.G
            took a taxi to come back. Finally, we felt asleep.

            This morning we did not do a lot, half of the group woke up for the

            and Pixel, followed by Oph√©lie, Quentin.G, Joana and Lou went to the
            beach by bus. They tried to swim in the ocean but it was too cold
            for everyone except for Quentin.G and Alix who defied the
            temperature and still stayed in the water.

            They made a sand castle for Pixel which became a throne in his
            honor, they took some pictures of him on his royal chair and went to
            a little breton restaurant where they ate waffles and crepes. At the
            end of the afternoon they took a shower after the beach and prepared
            themselves for a dinner at Ophelie's AirBnb. They ate a cocktail
            dinner while watching Mask Singer on the TV. Finally, they came back
            to the inn tired and ready to return to school the next day.

            7am and taking the metro to go to school. The first class of the day
            was about git and github. We did not learn a lot about this subject
            because we already knew most part of it. We ate at 1pm and prepared
            our presentation about a part of the french culture. We chose to
            present alcohol, cocktails and wines.

            Ethan created a kahoot with 20 questions at first but we reduced to
            13 questions. At 4pm, it was time to present it to Portuguese
            students, we were at a table to entertain them with our quiz. When
            school ended at 5pm, we came back to the hostel and ordered pizzas
            for everyone. Then Ethan, Quentin.C, Quentin.G and Adrien played
            Switch Sports with golf, bowling, badminton, volley-ball, football,
            chambara and tennis. After that, we ate the pizzas and went to bed.

            about Cisco company and their tools that they allow us to use. We
            remade exercises to train us to use them. At lunch, we ate at Lidl
            and we walked back to the inn to prepare our luggages and to chill
            before the evening. For the dinner, we had rendez-vous with Oph√©lie

            to be expelled from the restaurant. After the dinner, we came back

            the security control without any issues and waited 2 more hours
            before boarding in the plane. We took off at 1pm instead of 12:40pm
            and we flied for 2 hours again. And now let us narrate the story of
            the first fly of our pilot (don't worry it's a joke)... Unluckily
            for us, the pilot we had was not the best, he tried to land but
            failed and had to take off once again.

            We made some circles above Toulouse before trying again,
            successfully this time, to land on dry land. We had to wait for 30
            minutes in the air because the control station of our airport had a
            schedule it could not change easily. Each member of the group came
            back to his own house and took time to chill a bit before coming
            back to school on the next monday. Pixel, our best and most loyal
            friend during the trip leave us to return to the IPI school with its
            fantastic father, our director, Jean-Marc Benito.
