Finally, it's time to leave for Porto. The rendez-vous was at 1:15pm at the airport, it was time to meet up with the other class. Our group composed of Ethan, Alix, Adrien, Florian and Pixel was ready to fly to the second biggest Portuguese city. After waiting 3 hours we finally take off for a 2 hours fly. Barely off the plane, problems started. At the luggage receipt, everyone retrieved their own suitcase without any issue. Only one was missing, the Ethan's one. Because the latter saw it before, he was not worried about it. However, 5 then 10 minutes passed and still no sign of his suitcase, he then observed that only one blue luggage was left that looked like his own. Therefore, he understood that someone made a mistake and stole his suitcase.
