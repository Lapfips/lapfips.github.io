During his integration, he was subjected to hazing  and three of his comrades ended at the hospital. After this incident, he couldn't trust the school and its employee's skills anymore.  Furthermore, he discovered student parties and the excess of students. It was hard for him to integrate himself because he didn't like this kind of atmosphere. Because of what happened, he decided to give up on his engineer diploma and to follow an Informatic course. He discovered the IPI School in student exhibitions. After doing the open doors day at this school, he decided to integrate it. He likes what he is doing because he can feel that he is studying concrete topics  and that the knowledge he acquired will help him in the professional world.</p>
