                <p>The Ponte Infante Dom Henrique, also known as Ponte do Infante, is a road bridge that connects Vila Nova de Gaia to Porto, over the Douro River, in Portugal. It was named in honor of Infante D. Henrique, born in Porto. It is the most recent bridge that connects Porto and Gaia.

This metal arch bridge was the first railway bridge to join the two banks of the Douro, it was designed by Gustave Eiffel and his associate Théophile Seyrig within the construction company Eiffel et Cie. Opened in November 1877, it was decommissioned in 1991 and replaced by a modern structure, the Ponte de São João. It is named in honor of Maria Pia of Savoy (1847-1911) who became queen consort of Portugal.</p>
