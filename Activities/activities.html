    <h2> The cruise </h2>
        <p>We did a cruise on the Douro river and saw the six bridge of Porto: </p> <br>
        <p> <h3>The "Ponte Dom-Luís":</h3> <br>
            The Louis I Bridge is one of the bridges located on the Douro in Portugal, connecting Porto to Vila Nova de Gaia. Built between 1881 and 1886 by the engineer Théophile Seyrig, disciple of Gustave Eiffel, it closely resembles the Maria-Pia Bridge, located further upstream, but has an additional lower deck for road traffic. It is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p><br>
            <br>
        <p> <h3>The "Ponte Infante Dom Henrique":</h3> <br>
            The Ponte Infante Dom Henrique, also known as Ponte do Infante, is a road bridge that connects Vila Nova de Gaia to Porto, over the Douro River, in Portugal. Named in honor of Infante D. Henrique, born in Porto, it is the most recent bridge that connects Porto and Gaia. It was built to replace the upper deck of the Luís I Bridge, which was then converted for use by the "Yellow Line" (Hospital de São João/Santo Ovídio) of the Porto Metro.</p><br>
            <br>
        <p> <h3>The "Ponte maria pia":</h3> <br>
            The Maria Pia Bridge is a large railway viaduct which crosses the Douro2 in Porto (Portugal). This metal arch bridge, the first railway bridge to join the two banks of the Douro, was designed by Gustave Eiffel and his associate Théophile Seyrig within the construction company Eiffel et Cie. Opened in November 1877, it was decommissioned in 1991, replaced by a modern structure, the Ponte de São João. It is named in honor of Maria Pia of Savoy (1847-1911), then queen consort of Portugal.</p><br>
            <br>
        <p> <h3>The "Ponte de São João":</h3> <br>
            The São João Bridge is a railway infrastructure that transports the Northern Line over the Douro River, close to the city of Porto, in Portugal. Built to replace the already century-old D. Maria Pia Bridge, it entered service on June 24, 1991.</p><br>
            <br>
        <p> <h3>The "Ponte de Freixo":</h3> <br>
            They are actually two bridges built side by side and spaced just 10 cm apart. Each deck has 4 traffic lanes and is made up of 8 spans, the longest of which is 150 meters.</p><br>
            <br>
        <p> <h3>The "Ponte Arrábida":</h3> <br>
            The Arrábida Bridge is an arched bridge over the Douro River that connects Porto to Vila Nova de Gaia, in Portugal. Since the 1930s, it has been necessary to create alternative connections to the old bridges in order to respond to the growing flow of road traffic. At the time of its construction in 1963, the bridge had the largest reinforced concrete arch of any bridge in the world.</p><br>
