	  <h3 class="sectionContentSubTitle">Aix-en-Provence : 2005 - 2008</h3>
      <p class="sectionContent"> He was born in Aix-en-Provence where he lived for the first three years of his life with his parents. He was close to his grandparents' house, so they were able to keep him when his parents were working. However, in 2008, his parents decided to move to Toulouse and he had to change school. </p>
	  <h3 class="sectionContentSubTitle">Toulouse : 2008 - 2016</h3>
      <p class="sectionContent"> Once he came to Toulouse, he entered the school St-Aubin in the center of Toulouse close to Jean-Jaures from Petit-Nuage (2 years old) to CM2 (10 years old). From 2008 to 2010, he moved a lot because his parents wanted to find the perfect place for their family. They found it, they were happy but it was without the fact that his parents divorced in 2013 which marked the beginning of a succession of move either from his father's and mother's side. It was a hard time for him but he was still able to surpass it and have good results at school. </p>
	  <h3 class="sectionContentSubTitle">Toulouse : 2016 - 2020</h3>
      <p class="sectionContent"> For his middle-school years, he went to Sainte-Marie de Nevers, near the metro station of Jeanne d'Arc. He had really good results for his two first years there, and everything went smoothly. However, during the third year, he had some issues with his comrades and his grades dropped down to rock bottom, it was hard for him to handle it. This situation continued for his last year in middle-school, but fortunately for him but unfortunately for the world, the Covid-19 pandemic allowed him to escape from school. During this time, he sent neither his works nor messages except for a drawing in his german class. He was still able to get his Brevet with the highest mention. He is really proud of that.</p>
	  <h3 class="sectionContentSubTitle">Balma : 2020 - 2023</h3>
      <p class="sectionContent"> He went to the high-school Sainte-Marie de Nevers next to his former middle-school. When he first came to high-school, he wanted to have a decent start which he had. He met new people who became his close group. It was more or less the same group until the end of high-school. However, this group changed quite a lot because many different groups melt together. In this big new group, he met his wonderful girlfriend, they weren't close at first but started to talk during Summer vacation and ended up together. The final year of high-school was his happiest year since primary-school. He had good friends and a nice girlfriend. He was able to get his Baccalaur√©at with mention with really good grades in his specialties, Mathematics and Informatic.</p>
	  <h3 class="sectionContentSubTitle">Balma : 2023 - Today</h3>
      <p class="sectionContent"> During the last year of high-school, he received his letter of acceptance to the school he wanted to integrate: the IPI school. In september, he started his first year of college. Fortunately, his girlfriend wasn't far from him because she integrated an another school within the same campus. He also met new people who have the same passion as him. He loves what he is doing in this school because he can work and learn more about informatic which always was his favorite discipline. </p>
