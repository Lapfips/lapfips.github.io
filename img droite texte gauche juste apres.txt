                        We took a plane to go to Porto, the plane took off at 4:15pm, we arrived at Porto's airport at 5pm but a problem came up. The checked bag of Ethan was switched with another passenger of the plane. We stayed at the airport for 30 minutes to get the luggage back. Finally, the bus dropped us off at the hotel at 6pm. Between our arrival at the hotel and the moment we had dinner, we took a little aperitif. We then wandered in the streets of Porto to find a place to eat. We ended up going to an italian restaurant. We took pizzas, pastas and cocktails. Last, before going to sleep, we played a game of Werewolves of Millers Hollow.<br>
