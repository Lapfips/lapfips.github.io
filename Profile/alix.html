            <h3>Tournefeuille 2004 - 2015</h3>
            <p>
              He was born in Toulouse but he spent his life in Tournefeuille. For the first few years of his life, a nanny took care of him. He is still in contact with her and considers her as his third grand-mother. When he was 3 years old, his family welcomed a new member: a little brother. He spent really good years from pre-school to primary school where he had really good grades.

            <p>
              During his years in middle school, he studied in Léonard de Vinci middle-school where he was forced to take the latin option. Even if he was a little bit lost with his orientation, he spent those years with a solid group of friends and was able to maintain good grades. He chose to become an engineer and got his Baccalauréat with the highest mention.

            <h3>Tournefeuille/Toulouse 2019 - 2022</h3>
            <p>
              For his first year in high-school, he was in the Françoise highschool. He was in a class without his friends who were together. He spent a bad year at high-school for many reasons and his grades dropped down. After that, he decided to integrate the technological path and did a second year in STI2D at the highschool Déodat de Séverac in Toulouse next to Arènes. In this highschool, he discvered Informatic and started to take an interest to it. During his last year, he took the SIN speciality and was able to have his Baccalauréat with a good mention.

            <h3>Paris/Toulouse 2022 - 2024</h3>
            <p>
              After his Baccalauréat, he decided to pass an engineer diploma to invest himself more in Informatic. He integrated the ICAM school in Paris. During his time there, he lived in a student accomodation where he learnt how to live alone, how to do the shopping and the laundry, how to cook, the cost of life especially in Paris and so on. During his integration, he was subjected to hazing  and three of his comrades ended at the hospital. After this incident, he couldn't trust the school and its employee's skills anymore.  Furthermore, he discovered student parties and the excess of students. It was hard for him to integrate himself because he didn't like this kind of atmosphere. Because of what happened, he decided to give up on his engineer diploma and to follow an Informatic course. He discovered the IPI School in student exhibitions. After doing the open doors day at this school, he decided to integrate it. He likes what he is doing because he can feel that he is studying concrete topics  and that the knowledge he acquired will help him in the professional world.
