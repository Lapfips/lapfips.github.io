        <h1>Porto Wine :</h1>
        <a href="https://play.kahoot.it/#/?quizId=fea04b68-ff03-4b52-a26d-a862d3997adc"><button>Our presentation</button></a>
        <p>In class, we were asked to present a part of Porto's culture, in our group we decided to focus on "Wine, Cocktails, and Alcohol." We've created a Kahoot for you to participate in, accessible through the provided link. Alcohol plays an important role in the Portuguese culture, featuring a variety of cocktails and wines like "Vinho Verde" and "Ginja."

            <br><br>Porto is renowned for its Port wine, a sweet, fortified wine produced in the Douro Valley. It comes in several styles, including red, white, rosé, and Tawny. Port wine appeared back in the 17th century when British merchants added brandy to wine to preserve it, creating its rich flavors.
            
            <br><br>Another popular wine from the region is "Vinho Verde," or "Green Wine." This young wine, known for its slight effervescence and light, crisp flavor, is usually white but also comes in red and rosé. It's especially popular in the summer and pairs well with seafood.
            
            <br><br>Porto also has a vibrant cocktail culture. One of the famous cocktails is the "Porto Tonic," a mix of white Port wine and tonic water, garnished with lemon or lime. This drink highlights the versatility of Port wine.
            
            <br><br>Then, we have the "Ginja," or "Ginjinha,", a traditional Portuguese cherry liqueur. It is made by infusing sour cherries in alcohol, it's often enjoyed as a digestif and is popular in Lisbon, Óbidos, and Porto.
            
            <br><br>The culture of alcohol in Porto is rich and diverse, reflecting Portugal's history. From Port wine to Vinho Verde and Ginja liqueur, these beverages are important during social gatherings and celebrations in Portugal.</p>
